# What is Haxe?

What is it anyway?

Haxe is a programming language, with a standard library, a compiler, and a number of related tools. We often refer these as the Haxe toolkit.

Haxe is a programming language, just like C++, Java, and JavaScript. It provides us a way to tell computers what to do. In some sense, we can think of it as different computers or different platforms understand different languages. For example, an Android smartphone can directly understands programs written in Java, but not JavaScript. A web browser, however, can understand JavaScript directly, but not Java. Since we have plenty of platforms today, and we often want to target as many platforms as possible to maximize the number of potential users, eventually, we need to implement the same application a number of times, in different language. People realize this would cause much effort, and will directly increase the cost and time of software development. That's why people would try to find ways to use the same language across a number of platforms. For example, NodeJS was developed to run JavaScript on the server side, where traditionally runs PHP, Python, Java etc.
