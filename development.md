# Development Guide

The course is built using a combination of Git, GitLab, Gitbook, and Youtube.
The course website and most textual materials are written in Markdown, turned into HTML using Gitbook.

The development repo is located at https://gitlab.com/HaxeFoundation/HX101_Introduction-to-Cross-platform-Developemnt-with-Haxe.
It is a private repository. If you're interested in contributing to the course, contact Andy (andy@onthewings.net).
